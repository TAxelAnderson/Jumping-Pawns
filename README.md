# Jumping Pawns

This is a flipper zero application of a simple, chinese checkers like board game consisting of a 6x11 grid. Each player has 12 pawns, with the goal of moving all of your pawns to the other side of the board before your opponent. The pawns move by jumping over any other pawns horizontally or vertically. You are allowed to jump multiple times in a turn, changing directions as you wish. 

There is a PvP mode for local play and a PvE mode where you play against a simple minimax algorithm.

Feel free to leave any issues / PRs with bugs or feature ideas!
